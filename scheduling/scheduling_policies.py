    # For each node, fictitious arrival times of unscheduled jobs are used to
    # replace the original arrival times in the dominance theorems
    # The fictitious arrival time of a process i is the max of it's original
    # arrival time and the completion time of the last job of P.

    # When Q is empty:
    # Each descendant node is obtained by adding behind the
    # partial sequence P, a new process i, chosen among the unscheduled jobs
    # The choice of a job i is such that
    # (i) Not preceeded by another unscheduled jobs according to Theorems 2 and 4
    # (ii) It is not dominated by another unscheduled job according to Theorems
    #      3 and 5
    # (iii) job i and the last job of P verify the conditions of a T-active schedule

    # If the arrival time of all unscheduled jobs are smaller than the
    # completion time of P, each descendent node is obtained by adding a new job
    # i, from the unscheduled jobs, before the partial sequence Q

    # NOTE: When Q is empty, the completion time of job i is computed by adding
    # the sum of processing times of the unscheduled jobs to the completion time
    # of partial sequence P.

    # Choice of job i is such that there is no unscheduled job j
    # (i) j.deadline >= i.deadline and j.burst_time >= i.burst_time (at least
    # one of these inequalities is strict) or,
    # (ii) j.burst_time < i.burst_time and j.deadline > i.deadline and
    # j.deadline + j.burst_time >= delta, where delta = start_time of the first
    # job of Q.
    # (iii) The job i and first job of Q should also verify the conditions for a
    # schedule to be T-active

    # The lower bound is computed using Theorem 6. An upper bound is computed
    # for each descendant node by completing the partial sequences with the
    # heuristic NDPRTT.
    # If the solution found is better than the previous best, it is retained as
    # the new best.
    # A descendant node is eliminated if its lower bound is greater than or
    # equal to the total tardiness of the best solution found so far.
